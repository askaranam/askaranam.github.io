<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p> I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Information Systems and Analytics at the School of Computing in the National University of Singapore. 
	
	My primary research interest lies in the multidisciplinary domain of Digital Economy. 
	I am particularly interested in studying the economic impacts and underlying mechanisms of mobile app design, platform governance, the networked economy, and use-inspired Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning algorithms.
	In my research, I have also developed deep learning-based natural language processing algorithms and integrated them with econometrics to identify and explain strategic, actionable insights to academia and practitioners. 
	In the process, I gained a keen interest in analyzing varied facets of the digitized and networked economy, from social media sharing to user innovation to spillover effects to the behavior of AI-powered pricing algorithms. 
	</p>

	<!-- 	My research lies in the intersection of Economics and Computer Science. 
Am greatly interested in building market intelligent programs that can provide actionable insights for product developers. I develop/apply models from Deep Learning, Natural Language Understanding, and Econometrics in my research. </p>
 -->
	
<p> I obtained my PhD in Economics of Information Systems and Master's in Economics from UT, Austin. I obtained my bachelors in Information Systems from BITS, Pilani, India.</p>

<p> <em>If you are a current undergraduate/masters' student at the School of Computing or in the Business Analytics program, feel free to reach out to me for research/teaching assistant positions. </em> </p>
