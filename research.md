Here, you can find materials relevant to my published research and research in progress. I also provide titles for working papers and works in progress below. I provide full links for these papers when I believe they are ready for peer review. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in some of these projects. [My CV](http://askaranam.github.io/cv/) contains more information about where some of these projects are in the peer review process.

<!-- I also offer [a three-page research statement](/docs/svm-research-statement.pdf) that summarizes and contextualizes my different research agendas. -->
